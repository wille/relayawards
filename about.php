<center><h1>Information about RelayAwards</h1></br>
<h4>What is RelayAwards?</h4>
RelayAwards is a competition for all active and running Tor-relays. We believe that this can motivate operators to develop and reach new heights as a relay operator and therefore help the Tor network.<p>
You can compete against your friends, your family or why not yourself?! You can even try to become the best relay in your country! </br>
We built RelayAwards because we wanted something more than <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a>, something that motivated us to grow and become better as relay operators. We think it should be fun to do a good cause!<p>

</br></br>
<h4>Rules</h4>
The rules are pretty simple: there's a <a href="/awards.php">list of awards</a> that each relay will earn if it reaches the requirements.</br>
Some awards are easy to earn because they only require the operator to follow best practices.</br>
Some awards will take time and a lot of effort to earn.
There are even awards that are almost impossible to reach and if actually do reach them you will earn the glorious <a href="/images/rewards/king.png">crowne!</a><p>
</br></br>
<h4>FAQ</h4>
<b>Q: How do I participate?</b></br>
As long as you have a public and running relay you are participating! This is a competition for all public Tor-relays. </br></br>

<b>Q: Why does running an Alpha-version give 1 point?</b></br>
Running Alpha is not really best practices but we do believe running running an Alpha-version may help finding bugs.</br></br>

<b>Q: Some of my awards went away! Why?</b></br>
Relays will only earn awards if they are running and are currently reaching the requirements for the award so your relay either rebooted or does not qualify for the award. </br></br>

<b>Q: What is an exotic country?</b></br>
An exotic country is a country where few relays have been active historically. Data grabbed from <a href="https://torflow.uncharted.software/">Torflow.</a>
You can find the 2-letter ISO codes for them in the <a href="https://github.com/redpois0n/relayawards/blob/master/awards/exotic.php#L19">code.</a></br></br>

<b>Q: Will there be more awards in the future?</b></br>
Yes, hopefully! You can help us adding awards by creating an issue at <a href="https://github.com/redpois0n/relayawards/issues">Github.</a>
